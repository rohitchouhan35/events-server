make a folder named "allevents", open this in command prompt, run "git init"
run "git clone https://github.com/rohitchouhan35/events-server.git" in the folder

place this foler in "htdocs" in xampp or anywhere you want and modify the url in frontend here [click to see file (https://github.com/rohitchouhan35/events-client/blob/main/src/services/eventData.js)]

I have xampp and allevents is in htdocs folder and url formed is 

http://localhost/allevents/{file name}
